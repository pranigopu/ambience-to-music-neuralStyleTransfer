# Training logs
Logs of training for various models (not just the ones defined in `ImportsForModelHandling.ipynb`. These logs were taken when experimenting with different model architectures. The goal was to reach a sufficiently accurate (at least 90% training accuracy) and least overfitting architecture. While I have not maintained all the exact architectures, the following comparisons were made.

- With batch normalisation vs. without batch normalisation
- Using 1 or more convolutional layers with 3 $\times$ 3 max-pooling
